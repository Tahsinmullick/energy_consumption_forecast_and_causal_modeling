![electric poles](images/image3.jpg)



## Overview
The following project explores forecasting energy consumptions through machine learning approaches. The dataset is collected from Kaggle and contains information on several United States based power companies and their energy consumption across a number of years.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to answer important business decision:
- Adopt the CRISP-DM Project Management approach.
- Analyze historical energy consumption data.
- Apply machine learning techniques to forecast energy usage trends.
- Apply Causal machine learning to learn of causations between exisiting features and response variables.
- Identify key patterns and insights in energy consumption across various power companies 

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes detailed information on:
- Energy consumption by different United States-based power companies.
- Temporal data spanning multiple years.
- Energy consumption is the feature relevant to forecasting energy trends.

## Project Management
>  In order to build this I will follow the CRISP-DM approach of project management.

Reason to work following CRISP-DM:

- This project has a clear objective, where I will build forecast models to understand demand and derive causal inferences to develop business understanding.
- The project is an end-to-end pipline with documentation so that it allows easy traceability and reproduciability in future.
- There is minimal stakeholder involvement as it is an individual project

## Workflow
The 
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and formatting the dataset.
   - Handling missing or inconsistent data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualizing energy consumption patterns over time.
   - Identifying trends and correlations between features.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Selecting and creating relevant features for better forecasting accuracy.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Applying machine learning models such as regression, time series analysis, or neural networks.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.

## Visualizations
Below are some key visualizations used during the analysis:

## Results
- Successfully forecasted future energy consumption trends.
- Discovered valuable insights into the behavior of energy usage across companies and time periods.
  

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning for energy forecasting and provides actionable insights into energy consumption patterns. Further improvements can be made by incorporating additional features such as appliance usage or advanced models.
